        <p id="d">The Red Fort is the most popular and important of the forts in India. It was constructed under the leadership of Shah Jahan and since then has been home to various nobles and kings. Once, the fort's facade was graciously decorated with diamonds, but over the years the diamonds were stripped off as kings lost their wealth. Today, the Red Fort is an important landmark and is used for the Prime Minister's address to the nation on Independence Day.</p>
